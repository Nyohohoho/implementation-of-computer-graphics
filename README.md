# Implementation of computer graphics

I finished the exercises in [Openg Tutorial](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/) 1-8. Please note that only tutorial 3, 4, 5, 6 have exercises. My solutions are written as comments in the code.

However, I met a problem that I still don't know why and cannot find solution. Starting from tutorial 6, the interaction with keyboard and mouse is added, and when I moved my mouse or gave command by keyboard, the effect is strange (shown as below).
